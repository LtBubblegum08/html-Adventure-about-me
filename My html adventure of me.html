            <h1>Hello, My Name Is Finley</h1>
            <p>I design concept cars and like to do digital art as well as normal art. For my team at the Counter Spell Hack Event I was the lead artist. I'm into photography but I dont take it in school because I dont want to turn one of my hobbies into a assignment. I'm mainly into car photography for the obvious reason that I like cars. A little less obvious fact is since the age of 14 i've owned a vintage Japanese sports car and have been working on it since. the reason for me making this project is because I used to code with my dad since he builds systems for the military but I stopped and forgot how to code in python and in c sharp, I was never taught html so this is my first time making a project. please understand this is my first time and I am also self taught</p>
            <h2>A Little More About How I Learn</h2>
            <p>I take Comms Tech (communication technologie) where we learned a bit of photography and animation and graphic design as well as digital art which made me better at using my laptop and pen and helped me in my gane design. we just started a videography lesson so I will be starting to focus on that. <br> I was one of 11 students in my whole school who got to go to a conference and I was bored and started editing and teaching myself adobe Premier Pro and After Effects and a teacher approached me and started to talk to me and asked what I was doing and I showed him that I was photoshopping a car photo I took and was learning how to use Premier Pro and After Effects and he gave me advice on some software and then told me which of the two I should use for my certain circumstances. He then called the renowned professional photographer over and he was impressed with my editing and my photos and we talked and he told me what was good and gave me some advice on stuff I could try which was to shoot my photos in HDR because it would help a lot beacause of the style I edit in. Then the teacher talked with me and I gave him my phone which he then typed his email into and when we got intact with eachother he talked about inviting me to join a film team. Today is Thursday December 12th and tommorow on Friday at lunch time I will get an invite link to join a call and talk about it. Wish me luck! <br> If you have any advice on hwo to improve my work or any websites that could help me just email finleygambin1@gmail.com</p>
